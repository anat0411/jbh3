ON AppleProducts.id = orders_products.product_id

INNER JOIN newschema.orders AS orders //Join orders_products file with orders file
ON orders_products.order_id=orders.id

INNER JOIN newschema.customers AS customers //Join orders file with customers file
ON orders.customer_id = customers.id

2. Who orderd two computers?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS HowManyComputersBought, customers.name FROM newschema.products AS products
LEFT JOIN newschema.orders_products AS orders_products //Join all products with orders_products having products which purchased
ON products.id=orders_products.product_id 
LEFT JOIN newschema.orders AS orders //Join orders with orders_products 
ON orders.id=orders_products.order_id
LEFT JOIN newschema.customers AS customers //Join customers with their orders
ON customers.id=orders.customer_id
WHERE products.name IN ('Apple macbook pro', 'Asus laptop') //See which customer has one or two of computers names
GROUP BY products.id
HAVING HowManyComputersBought= 2

SELECT COUNT(orders_products.product_id) AS SumOfProducts, orders.customer_id, customers.id AS customer_id, customers.name FROM newschema.customers AS customers
LEFT JOIN newschema.orders AS orders //Brings all customers and connects them with their orders.id
ON customers.id= orders.id
LEFT JOIN newschema.orders_products AS orders_products //Join orders id's in orders & orders_products
ON orders_products.order_id = orders.id
GROUP BY customers.name

4. What is the average purchase price?

SELECT AVG (sumOrder) AS avgPrice FROM
(SELECT SUM(products.price) AS sumOrder FROM newschema.orders_products AS orders_products
INNER JOIN newschema.products AS products //Join products with the order to sum order by the product's price
ON orders_products.product_id=products.id
INNER JOIN newschema.orders AS orders //Join orders with orders_products to sum order  
ON orders.id=orders_products.order_id
GROUP BY orders.id)
AS avgPrice
